I continue to work adding the winners declaration and stop the game if one of the players had been busted,
I made it to work for more than one round but the backend doesn’t support that so the deal button will restart the game
but the score will not change ,also the game will go slow after some time(I don’t know why) 
and sometimes the messages doesn’t pop upand we will fix this and add the score and round in the next iteration.
