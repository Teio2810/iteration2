I continue to work adding the winners declaration and stop the game if one of the players had been busted,
I made it to work for more than one round but the backend doesn’t support that so the deal button will restart the game
but the score will not change ,also the game will go slow after some time(I don’t know why) 
and sometimes the messages doesn’t pop upand we will fix this and add the score and round in the next iteration.

In this homework me and Rana  we was a QA.
I write tests for every function that the backend developer write and tell them if I found bugs or problems in the code.
I didn't write test for the createDealLogic and createStandLogic function because they have the same code of createHitLogic
function.

I am the team leader, in this week we complete our implementation for the second iteration and writing the tests for the
methods in the model package.
In this iteration we have a whole round in the game that works! All the buttons(deal , hit and stand) are working and 
declaring the winner. 
Next iteration we’ll have a whole game with more than one round.
